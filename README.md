### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on [`Deltroid`](http://bit.ly/deltroid-twitter), and Therapii (for Android / iOS) - if you'd like to directly support my passion / hobby / weekend-dev work, you can subscribe to my **personal** Patreon, just use `https://bit.ly/support-joelle-on-patreon` to become a patron of my work 💕
- 🌱 I co-moderate and provide tech support for the communities of [`r/AltStore`](https://bit.ly/altstore-reddit), [`r/Delta_Emulator`](https://bit.ly/delta-reddit), and the Delta / AltStore [`Public Discord`](http://bit.ly/altmember-public-discord-invite) and [`Patron Discord`](https://bit.ly/altpatron-preview) (preview link, you will be automatically removed from the server by `AltBot` unless you become a patron on AltStore + Delta's [`Patreon`](http://bit.ly/rileytestut-patreon))
- 👩‍💼 I use Trello for project management. Here are the public ones I co-manage: [`AltStore`](http://bit.ly/altstore-features), [`Delta`](https://bit.ly/delta-features), and [`Clip`](https://bit.ly/clip-features)
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on iOS (JB and Jailed), Android, and web dev projects in terms of backend, REing, infrastructure, and project management
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with JB tweak development specifically (brand new to it)
- 💬 Ask me about anything jailed iOS (I probably have an answer for you)
- 📫 How to reach me: https://twitter.com/lonkles
- 😄 Pronouns: They / Them
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm autistic
