- 😄 Pronouns: They / Them (but you can use whatever pronouns you like, enby just fits my personality best)
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm probs undiagnosed autistic (and def neurodivergent) but it's so late in my adult life that it's impossible to try to get a real diagnosis (I've been masking for so long) - but I'm trying to get one just to prove to myself why I'm such a goofball of a person.

<br />

- 🔭 Currently focusing my work on [`SideStore for iOS`](https://bit.ly/sidestore-twitter) and [`Provenance Emu`](https://bit.ly/provenance-twitter) - if you'd like to directly support my passion(s), just use [`bit.ly/support-joelle-on-patreon`](https://bit.ly/support-joellestickney-on-patreon) to become a patron of my work 💕
- 🌱 I run / co-moderate / provide tech support on the [`SideStore Discord`](https://bit.ly/altmember-delta-general-chat), [`r/Provenance_Emu`](https://bit.ly/provenance-reddit), [`r/AltStore`](https://bit.ly/altstore-reddit), and [`r/Delta_Emulator`](https://bit.ly/delta-reddit).
- 👩‍💼 I use Trello for project management. Here are the public projects I co-manage: [`AltStore`](https://bit.ly/altstore-features), [`Delta`](https://bit.ly/delta-features), and [`Clip`](https://bit.ly/clip-features)
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on iOS (jb and jailed), and webdev projects in terms of backend, REing, infrastructure, and project management
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with JB tweak development specifically (brand new to it)
- 💬 Ask me about anything about iOS or retro video games and I'll probably have an answer for you
