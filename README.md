### My Life

- 📫 If you want to interact with me *personally* on Discord, you can join **Joelle's Digital House**: [`discord.gg/AU7Rbv8`](https://bit.ly/joelles-digital-house-discord-invite) - otherwise, reach out via [`twitter.com/lonkelle`](https://bit.ly/lonkelle-twitter), [`mastodon.social/@lonkelle`](https://bit.ly/lonkelle-mastodon), or [`reddit.com/lonkelle`](https://bit.ly/lonkelle-reddit-profile)
- 😄 Pronouns: They / Them (you can use whatever pronouns you like, enby just fits me best)
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm probs undiagnosed autistic (and def neurodivergent) - but I'm trying to get an actual diagnosis just to prove to myself why I'm such a goofball of a person.
- 💬 Ask me about anything about iOS or retro video games and I'll probably have an answer for you

### My Work

- 🔭 Currently focusing on [`SideStore for iOS`](https://bit.ly/sidestore-twitter) and [`Provenance Emu`](https://bit.ly/provenance-twitter) - if you'd like to directly support my passion(s), just use [`bit.ly/support-joelle-on-patreon`](https://bit.ly/support-joellestickney-on-patreon) to become a patron of my work 💕
- 🌱 I run / co-moderate / provide tech support on the [`SideStore Discord`](https://bit.ly/altmember-delta-general-chat), [`r/Provenance_Emu`](https://bit.ly/provenance-reddit), [`r/AltStore`](https://bit.ly/altstore-reddit), [`r/Delta_Emulator`](https://bit.ly/delta-reddit), and [`r/SideStore`](https://bit.ly/sidestore-reddit).
- 👩‍💼 I use Trello for project management. Here are the public projects I co-manage: [`AltStore`](https://bit.ly/altstore-features), [`Delta`](https://bit.ly/delta-features), and [`Clip`](https://bit.ly/clip-features)

### My Interests

- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on iOS (jb and jailed) and webdev projects in terms of infrastructure, and project management
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with JB tweak development specifically (brand new to it)
- 🎮 I want to start / join a team to work on retro games that will also publish on Steam / eShop / PSN
