### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on [`Deltroid`](https://bit.ly/deltroid-twitter), and Therapii (for Android / iOS) - if you'd like to directly support my passion / hobby / weekend-dev work, just use [`bit.ly/support-joelle-on-patreon`](https://bit.ly/support-joelle-on-patreon) to become a patron of my work 💕
- 🌱 I co-moderate and provide tech support for the communities of [`r/AltStore`](https://bit.ly/altstore-reddit), [`r/Delta_Emulator`](https://bit.ly/delta-reddit), and the Delta / AltStore [`Public Discord`](https://bit.ly/altmember-delta-general-chat) and [`Patron Discord`](https://bit.ly/altpatron-preview) (preview link, you will be automatically removed from the server by `AltBot` unless you become a patron on AltStore + Delta's [`Patreon`](https://bit.ly/rileytestut-patreon))
- 👩‍💼 I use Trello for project management. Here are the public ones I co-manage: [`AltStore`](https://bit.ly/altstore-features), [`Delta`](https://bit.ly/delta-features), and [`Clip`](https://bit.ly/clip-features)
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on iOS (JB and Jailed), Android, and web dev projects in terms of backend, REing, infrastructure, and project management
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with JB tweak development specifically (brand new to it)
- 💬 Ask me about anything jailed iOS (I probably have an answer for you)
- 📫 How to reach me: [`twitter.com/lonkles`](https://twitter.com/lonkelle)
- 😄 Pronouns: They / Them
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm probably undiagnosed autistic (for multiple reasons) but it's so late in my adult life that it's impossible to try to get a real diagnosis (I've been masking for too long)
